 Cosine similarity is a method for measuring similarity between vectors. Mathematically, it calculates the cosine of the angle between the two vectors. If the angle between the two vectors is zero, the similarity is calculated as 1 because the cosine of zero is 1. So the two vectors are identical. The cosine of any angle varies from 0 to 1. Therefore, similarity rates will vary from 0 to 1. The formula is expressed as follows:
